Chime Financial Inc. in an online-only financial technology company that offers checking and savings accounts to it's customers.  Though commonly referred to as Chime Bank, it is not a bank.  Banking services are provided by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC.   All Chime accounts are FDIC insured up to the standard maximum of $250,000 per depositor.<p>
Chime was founded by Chris Britt and Ryan King in 2012 with the vision of providing basic online banking services with virtually no fees.  From the company's website, "Chime is a financial technology company founded on the premise that basic banking services should be helpful, easy and free. We want to profit with our members, not from them. That’s why our model doesn’t rely on overdraft fees, monthly service fees, service fees, minimum balance requirements, and more. We partner with regional banks to design member first financial products. This creates a more competitive market with better, lower-cost options for everyday Americans who aren’t being served well by traditional banks. We help drive innovation, inclusion, and access across the industry."<p>
Chime has grown exponentially since inception in 2012. The company now has over 13 million active accounts and is considered number one in the "challenger" bank space. Chime has raised a total of $2.3B in funding over 9 rounds. Their latest funding on Aug 13, 2021 raised $750 million. Chime is funded by 31 investors. General by Atlantic and Tiger Global Management are the most recent investors. The company's valuation is estimated at $25 billion privately with an IPO expected later this year in the $35-$45 billion range.<p>
Chime Financial targets a younger demographic who desire simple banking features and don't want to pay the fees charged by larger brick and mortar banks.  They have achieved this by offering fee-free checking and savings accounts as well as a Visa credit card.  Furthermore, they offer a Credit Builder app that allows users increase their credit score while using the service.  Chime has out papced its competiors with its simplicity and it's commitment to zero fees. The table below, showing Chime's closest competitors, illustrates this:

Chime has incorpoarted the use of artificial intelegence in its marketing strategy.  According to Guy Yalif, CEO of Intellimize, Chime is using AI to create a sophisticated testing approach to determine which marketing tactics to deploy. According to Yalif: “Chime’s marketing team was able to test 21 different ideas and 216 different versions of their homepage while improving its performance. Had they used a simpler A/B model to test out these 21 ideas, it would have taken nine years to do what they did in three months.”

Chime generates it's revenue by charging interchange fees whenever their debit card is used.  Interchange fees are fees merchants pay to financial institutions (usually around 1.5%); they earn a portion of this fee for every transaction.  Going forward the company the company should consider offering checking accounts with interest (as some of their competitors do) and launch a traditional credit card.  Presently their Credit Bulider Visa credit card is a no annual fee, no interest, secured credit card (prepaid) that helps you build your credit.  For higher earning customers they could offer a traditional credit card to increase revenues.  With a broadening customer demographic and an impending IPO, Chime continues to be a growth story.
