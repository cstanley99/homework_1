From the company's website, "Chime is a financial technology company founded on the premise that basic banking services should be helpful, easy and free. We want to profit with our members, not from them. That’s why our model doesn’t rely on overdraft fees, monthly service fees, service fees, minimum balance requirements, and more. We partner with regional banks to design member first financial products. This creates a more competitive market with better, lower-cost options for everyday Americans who aren’t being served well by traditional banks. We help drive innovation, inclusion, and access across the industry."<p>

Chime has incorpoarted the use of artificial intelegence in its marketing strategy.  According to Guy Yalif, CEO of Intellimize, Chime is using AI to create a sophisticated testing approach to determine which marketing tactics to deploy. According to Yalif: “Chime’s marketing team was able to test 21 different ideas and 216 different versions of their homepage while improving its performance. Had they used a simpler A/B model to test out these 21 ideas, it would have taken nine years to do what they did in three months.”
